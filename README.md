# Project Name

I've been asked about parallax a few times recently so I decided to refamilarize myself with it a bit. It's actually been a long time since I worked with html/js/css and not angular or react, npm, node, sass, etc so it was fun. I would like to make a much taller page to have more fun but this was just to knock the cobwebs off.
